# AIMS-Octomap (LiDAR to OctoMap Publisher)

This project provides a pipeline to read LiDAR data over serial(for Mac, use COM4 otherwise) and publish it into [OctoMap](https://octomap.github.io/) for 3D occupancy mapping.  
Itâ€™s designed to work with LiDAR hardware and integrates into a ROS2-based environment. It can combine multiple lidar scans from multiple drones into a single map that can be continually updated.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Reads data from a LiDAR device.
- Converts raw data into usable range scans.
- Publishes scans to an OctoMap subscriber node.
- Saves maps for future access and updates.
